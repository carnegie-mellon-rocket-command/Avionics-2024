/**
 * Functionality related to the Seeed XIAO nRF52840 Sense's inbuild 2MB of QSPI flash (specifically,
 * 2 MiB). This header provides a file descriptor-like interface to the QSPI flash.
 * 
 * This file allows the flash to operate in two modes: read mode, and write mode. Both offer a
 * sequential one-time pass through the flash memory, with either reading or writing supported.
 * Which mode is active is supplied when qspi_init_flash() is called. 
 * 
 * Note that these modes are not limitations of the QSPI flash, but rather limitations imposed
 * by this interface. The motivation for this is code correctness - for our particular use case,
 * it does not make sense to both read and write, or to read/write non-sequentially.
 * 
 * In write mode, sequential writing is supported to the entire of flash memory, starting at
 * address 0x04. Addresses 0x00 - 0x03 store the end of what has currently been written to flash,
 * as a little-endian unsigned 32 bit integer. This is written so that subsequent uses of the flash
 * in read mode know where to stop reading. Write mode overwrites all previous data on the flash.
 * 
 * In read mode, the end address is first loaded from addresses 0x00 - 0x03. Sequential reading
 * is supported up until this address (non-inclusive).
